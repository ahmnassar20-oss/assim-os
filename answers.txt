part1:
1.process_creation.c: 
This program uses fork() 
to create a new process. 
The code checks the return value pid: if pid == 0, 
it's the child process ; if pid > 0, 
it's the parent process.

2.file1.c + file2.c: 
This example shows the Linker's job. 
file2.c calls the hello() function , which is defined in file1.c . 
The Linker's job is to connect this call to the function definition when creating the final program.

3.simple_program.c: 
This is a basic program used to show the Loader's job . 
Running ldd on it lists the shared libraries it needs . 
The Loader is responsible for loading these libraries into memory when the program starts

Part 2: What is the job of the Linker?
The Linker takes one or more "Object Code" files (produced by the compiler) and "links" them together. 
It resolves references between files (like the hello() function) and combines them with any necessary libraries to create a single "Executable file"

Part 3: What is the job of the Loader?
The Loader is part of the operating system.
It takes the "Executable file" (produced by the Linker) and copies it from storage into the computer's "Memory" . 
It also loads any required shared libraries (like ldd shows) so the CPU can start running the program
