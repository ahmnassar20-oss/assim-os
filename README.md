# CSE233 - Operating Systems - Assignment 2

This is the solution for Assignment 2, focusing on basic C development, forks, the linker, and the loader.

## Project Contents

* `.c` files: Code examples from Lab 5.
* `answers.txt`: Detailed explanations for all required questions.
* `makefile`: Compiles all C programs.
* `README.md`: This file.
* `LICENSE`: MIT License file.
* `/screenshots`: Contains screenshots of compilation and execution.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Compile all programs:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```

2.  **Run the programs:**
    ```bash
    ./process_creation
    ./output_program
    ./simple_program
    ```

3.  **Check dynamic libraries (Loader test):**
    ```bash
    ldd simple_program
    ```

4.  **Clean the executable files:**
